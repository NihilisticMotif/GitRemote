Git fork is used when you want to develop other people's project, 
but you do not have the permission to directly modify their code. 
So you can copy their code by fork it in Github website (there is not 'git fork' command),
Then using 'git clone' for cloning their code in your personal computer.

After git commit and git push (update your work in your online forked repository), you have to 'pull request'
the person who owned the original project will decide if they should utilize your code.

There are 3 branchs to consider.
1. main 
* branch in your local computer.
2. origin/main 
* branch in your online fork (copied) repository.
3. upstream/main 
* branch of their online repository.

You can also update the forked repository, regarding to their repository.
